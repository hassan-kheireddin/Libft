## About the Project

Libft is the first project at 42 École that introduces students to fundamental programming concepts and data structures in C. The main objective is to create a custom library by reimplementing essential C functions like `strlen`, `strcpy`, and others while exploring new ones such as linked list manipulation.

This project serves as a stepping stone for understanding the inner workings of the C standard library and lays the groundwork for future projects.

## Features

- **Standard C Library Functions:** Reimplementation of functions like `memset`, `strdup`, and `atoi`.
- **Additional Utility Functions:** New functions that are not part of the standard library but are widely useful, such as `ft_split` and `ft_itoa`.
- **Linked List Functions:** Manage and manipulate linked lists with ease.
- **Memory Management:** Functions like `ft_calloc` and `ft_bzero` for efficient memory operations.
- **Comprehensive Testing:** Fully tested and debugged to ensure reliability.
